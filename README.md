## 🚀 Large Core Changes Incoming!

Mihari is evolving from a simple HTML + JS app into a full-fledged system powered by **React + TypeScript** on the frontend, bringing you a smoother and more modern experience! 💻✨

- 🌟 **Frontend Overhaul:** The desktop app will be rebuilt using React + TypeScript for better performance and maintainability.
- 📱 **New Platforms:** An Android version and a website version are in development, so Mihari can be with you everywhere.
- 🛠️ **Backend Server:** A dedicated backend will handle all the heavy lifting for the website and Android apps.
- 🖥️ **Desktop Independence:** The desktop version will stay fully local — no server required — ensuring fast, private, and offline-friendly use.

The backend server is almost finished! Next up: wrapping up the desktop app, publishing its release, and then moving on to the Android and web versions. Everything is currently in progress and shaping up nicely! 🌸
